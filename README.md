  ## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing dependencies)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repo-url.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd countries-fe
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    ## Starting the Development Server

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will start at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default. You can access the application via your browser at this address.
## Running the Build

To create a production build of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```
## Environment Variables

The frontend requires the backend API URL to fetch data. Make sure you set the correct base URL in the `useFetch` hook located in the `hooks/useFetch.js` file.

By default, the `baseUrl` is set to:

```js
const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1';
```
You can update this based on the backend server location.

## Testing the Application

To test the responsiveness and basic functionality of the app, simply visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in various screen sizes or use your browser's dev tools to simulate mobile screens.

## Usage

### Searching for Countries

On the homepage, you can search for countries using the search bar. Type the name of the country and the results will filter as you type.

### Viewing Country Information

Click on any country from the list to see more details about it, including the flag, population data (displayed in charts), and neighboring countries.

### Neighboring Countries

On the country information page, you'll see a list of neighboring countries. Clicking on any neighboring country will update the displayed data to show information about that specific country.
